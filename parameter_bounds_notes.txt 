tref_scaling_myocardium: based on experience in ventricular simulations
cal50_myocardium: in the Land paper, the cellular value is 2.5 uM, the ventricular value is 0.805 um. This means there
is a lot of wriggle room for this parameter. The smaller the cal50 value, the higher the LVEF, hence, I've reduced the
lower bound to 0.3
sfkws_myocardium: in the Land paper, kws was increased by 3-fold in ventricular simulations, while kuw is increased by
7-fold. Again, this means there is a lot of wriggle room for this parameter. From experience, we know that higher kws
gives better LVEF, so I'm allowing this to go up to 7-fold.
pericardial_stiffness: 20 kPa/cm was quoted in reference #49 in manuscript, hence lower bound, then 500 kPa/cm is referenced
in #50 in another paper.
Kct_myocardium: Francesc's paper had lower bound at 10 kPa, but my cube simulations show that 5000 kPa is necessary for
getting good stress-strain curves. Hence, the range of search. From experience, the lower Kct, the higher the LVEF.
a, af, as, afs: Lower bounds come from dog shear experiments, while upper bound comes from human data. From experience, these
paramaeters don't have great effects on the LVEF.
R_LV: 750 mmHg ms/mL to 852 mmHg ms/mL are quoted from two papers. But I've widened this range, because our circulation
model is not super detailed. So I've allowed it to go from half to the baseline value. Smaller the R, larger the LVEF.
C_LV: Same rationale as R, because the circulatory model is not very sophisticated, I'm allowing the value to range from
half to the baseline value (0.00015 mL/Barye)
ejection threshold: 9.7 kPa to 10.3 kPa is the literature range, however, again, this is not a lot of range to explore.
From experience, the lower this value is, the higher the LVEF. So, I'm giving this also 0.5 to baseline.

It ran up to the 'as' parameter.
