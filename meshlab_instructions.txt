Filter -> Point Set -> Point Cloud Simplification 
Around 5000 points should do it.

Filter -> Point Set -> Compute normals for point sets 

Filter -> Remeshing, Simplification and Reconstruction -> Surface Reconstruction: Ball Pivoting 

Increase the world unit for the Ball until the mesh is watertight 

Save the new layer

Filter ->  Remeshing, Simplification and Reconstruction ->  Remeshing: Isotropic Explicit Remeshing 

Leave everything as default. This will now remesh the whole surface to the most common resolution.
